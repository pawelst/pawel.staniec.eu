Hello there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to launch this blog as a space to share my thoughts on software engineering, technology leadership, and the lessons I've learned throughout my career.

## What You Can Expect

As a Chief Technology Officer with 15+ years of experience, I'll be writing about:

- **System Architecture**: Designing scalable, maintainable systems
- **Team Leadership**: Building and leading engineering teams
- **Technology Trends**: My take on emerging technologies and their impact
- **Personal Growth**: The journey from application engineer to CTO
- **Fun Stuff**: Because work should be enjoyable too! ðŸš€

## A Little About Me

I'm passionate about building performant, accessible web experiences. By day, I optimize complex processes and design global-scale systems. By standup, I sneak in dad jokes to keep things agile and fun.

When I'm not coding or leading teams, you might find me:
- Contributing to open source projects
- Learning new technologies
- Sharing knowledge with the developer community

## Let's Connect

I'd love to hear your thoughts on any of my posts. Feel free to reach out on [GitHub](https://github.com/pawelst) or connect with me on other platforms.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find something valuable here!
